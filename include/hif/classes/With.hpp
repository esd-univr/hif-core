/// @brief Selected signal assignment.

/// @details
/// This class represents a VHDL selected signal assignment
/// (<tt>with / select</tt> construct).
/// According to the value of the expression featured in the <tt>with</tt>
/// construct, a corresponding value is assigned to the item featured in
/// the <tt>select</tt> construct.
/// The item featured in the <tt>select</tt> construct is stored as target
/// of an Assign object in HIF.
/// Conversely, the value featured in the <tt>with</tt> construct is stored
/// as the <tt>with</tt> expression.
/// The list of alternatives (WithAlt) contain a specific value which is
/// to be taken on by the <tt>with</tt> expression, and an associated value.
/// Additionally, a default value can be specified.
