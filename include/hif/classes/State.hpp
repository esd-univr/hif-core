/// @brief State in an finite state machine.
///
/// @details
/// A state s of a state table is identified by a unique name, and has a list
/// of actions associated to it. This action list is executed sequentially
/// whenever the state machine is in state s and performs a transition.
///
/// The transition relation of the state machine is defined by the action
/// list using the @c NEXTSTATE statement: whenever an execution path of the
/// action list terminates with a @c NEXTSTATE statement, the state machine
/// will enter the state specified in the statement. If the last statement of
/// an execution path is not a @c NEXTSTATE statement, the state machine will
/// stay in the current state.
///
/// Note that state machines defined by state tables are necessarily
/// deterministic due to the semantics of sequential statement lists: if more
/// than one execution paths exist whose conditions are true, it is always
/// the first encountered path (where the order of the paths is given by the
/// order of the actions in the list) which is executed.
