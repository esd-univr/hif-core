/// @brief A State table.
///
/// @details
/// A state table defines a process whose main control structure is a finite
/// state machine. The entry state of the machine can be specified
/// explicitly. Otherwise, the first state in the state list is considered as
/// entry state.
///
/// Additionally, a state table can have a sensitivity list which contains
/// the names of certain signals. The transitions of the state machine are
/// triggered by this sensitivity list: whenever an edge on any of the
/// signals in the list occurs, the state machine performs a transition.
///
/// A state table may have local declarations.
///
/// Note that state tables can describe sequential as well as combinational
/// processes: in the case of a combinational process, the sensitivity list
/// must contain all the signals which are read in the state table.
///
